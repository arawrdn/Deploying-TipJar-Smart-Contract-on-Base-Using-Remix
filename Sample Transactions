🛠️ How to Interact with the Contract
Donate with a Message:

In Remix, expand the donate function.

Enter your message in the _message field (e.g., "Keep it up!").

Set the value in the "Value" field to the amount of ETH you wish to donate (e.g., 0.001).

Click Transact and confirm the transaction in your MetaMask wallet.

Donate without a Message:

Send ETH directly to the contract address: 0xBbD4f3BA2b7DE63B3622eBFb54B5E2C91D566046.

The contract will record the donation with a default message: "No message".

📌 Notes

Always test on the Base Sepolia testnet before deploying on Base Mainnet.

Donations and withdrawals are visible on BaseScan under the Events tab.

This contract serves as a simple on-chain project to showcase on GitHub.
